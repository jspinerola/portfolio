Junior first-generation student at Texas A&M University-San Antonio studying Computer Science with a passion for inclusivity and accessibility in tech. By participating in hackathon competitions, learning web-focused technologies such as JavaScript and React.js, and working part-time as a Web Developer for my campus, I hope to expand my technical skillset and positively impact the tech field through equity-focused design.
